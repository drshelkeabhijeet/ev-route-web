# Map Station Display - Complete Fix

## 🎯 Problem
Stations were being received from the n8n API but not displaying on the map in the "Plan Your Route" screen.

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### 1. **Enhanced Debugging**
Added comprehensive console logging to track station data flow:

#### In Route Page (`app/dashboard/route/page.tsx`)
- Logs each station's coordinates after processing
- Validates lat/lng are valid numbers
- Shows total stations and selected vs available counts

#### In Map Component (`components/map/Map.tsx`)
- Logs when stations are received
- Logs each marker creation with coordinates
- Confirms markers are added to the map
- Shows total markers created

### 2. **Auto-Fit Map Bounds**
Added automatic map bounds adjustment to ensure all stations are visible:
- Creates bounds from all station markers
- Includes route polyline points if available
- Automatically zooms/pans map to show everything
- **This is the key fix** - previously the map might not be zoomed to the right area

### 3. **Robust Coordinate Parsing**
Already in place, but reinforced:
- Handles multiple coordinate field names (lat, latitude, location.latitude, etc.)
- Parses string coordinates to numbers
- Filters out invalid coordinates with warnings
- Handles both `lng` and `lon` variations

## 🔍 How to Test

### Step 1: Open Browser Console
1. Open http://localhost:3000/dashboard/route
2. Press F12 to open Developer Tools
3. Go to the "Console" tab

### Step 2: Plan a Route
1. Fill in origin and destination
2. Click "Plan Route"
3. Watch the console logs

### Step 3: Check Console Output
You should see logs like:
```
Route planning response: {charging_plan: {...}, route: {...}}
Processed all stations: 5 [{...}, {...}, ...]
Station 1: ChargePoint Station at {lat: 37.7749, lng: -122.4194, is_selected: true}
Station 2: Tesla Supercharger at {lat: 37.7849, lng: -122.4094, is_selected: false}
...
Map: Updating station markers, received stations: 5
Creating marker 1 for ChargePoint Station: {lat: 37.7749, lng: -122.4194, is_selected: true}
Marker 1 created successfully: (37.7749, -122.4194)
...
Map: Created 5 markers on the map
Map: Bounds adjusted to fit all stations and route
```

### Step 4: Verify on Map
- **Orange markers** = Selected stations (in optimal route)
- **Green markers** = Available stations (alternatives)
- Map should **automatically zoom** to show all stations
- Hover over markers to see station names
- Click markers to see details in the sidebar

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Still no markers visible

**Check 1: Console Logs**
```
Map: Created 0 markers on the map
```
→ Stations aren't being passed to Map component
→ Check that `stations` state is set in route page

**Check 2: Invalid Coordinates**
```
Invalid coordinates for station: Station ABC {latRaw: undefined, lngRaw: undefined}
```
→ API response doesn't have coordinate data
→ Check n8n webhook response format

**Check 3: Markers Created But Not Visible**
```
Map: Created 5 markers on the map
Map: Bounds adjusted to fit all stations and route
```
But still can't see them?
→ Map might be zoomed too far out/in
→ Try zooming out manually
→ Check if Google Maps API key is valid

### Issue: Markers appear but in wrong location

**Check:** Console logs show coordinates
```
Creating marker 1 for Station: {lat: 0, lng: 0, is_selected: true}
```
→ Coordinates are (0, 0) or invalid
→ Problem is with n8n API response format
→ Check field names in API response

### Issue: Map shows but is gray/blank

**Check:** Google Maps API Key
- Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` is set in `.env.local`
- Check API key is enabled in Google Cloud Console
- Check for errors in browser console

## 📊 Expected Console Output

### Successful Flow:
```
1. "Sending data to n8n webhook:" {...}
2. "Route planning response:" {charging_plan: {...}, route: {...}}
3. "Processed all stations: 5" [{...}, {...}, ...]
4. "Station 1: Name at {lat: X, lng: Y, is_selected: true}"
5. "Map: Updating station markers, received stations: 5"
6. "Creating marker 1 for Name: {lat: X, lng: Y, is_selected: true}"
7. "Marker 1 created successfully: (X, Y)"
8. "Map: Created 5 markers on the map"
9. "Map: Bounds adjusted to fit all stations and route"
```

### If Stations Not Found:
```
1. "Sending data to n8n webhook:" {...}
2. "Route planning response:" {route: {...}}
3. "Processed all stations: 0" []
4. "Map: Updating station markers, received stations: 0"
5. "Map: Created 0 markers on the map"
```
→ n8n response doesn't have `charging_plan.all_stations` or `charging_plan.selected_stations`

## 🎨 Visual Indicators

### On the Map:
- 🟠 **Orange markers with lightning bolt** = Selected/recommended stations
- 🟢 **Green markers with lightning bolt** = Available alternative stations
- 🔵 **Blue polyline** = Your route path

### In the Card Header:
Shows station counts:
- "Selected Stations (2)" - Stations in your optimal route
- "Available Stations (8)" - All other stations

### In the Sidebar (when clicking a marker):
- Station name
- Address
- Charger types and power levels
- Amenities
- Ratings and availability

## 🔧 What Changed

### Files Modified:

1. **`app/dashboard/route/page.tsx`**
   - Added detailed station coordinate logging
   - Added validation messages

2. **`components/map/Map.tsx`**
   - Added station marker creation logging
   - **Added auto-fit bounds functionality** ⭐ KEY FIX
   - Added marker position verification
   - Improved debug output

### Key Addition - Auto-Fit Bounds:
```typescript
// Auto-fit map bounds to show all stations if we have any
if (newMarkers.length > 0) {
  const bounds = new google.maps.LatLngBounds()
  newMarkers.forEach(marker => {
    const position = marker.getPosition()
    if (position) {
      bounds.extend(position)
    }
  })
  
  // Include route points in bounds if we have a route
  if (route && route.length > 0) {
    route.forEach(point => {
      bounds.extend({ lat: point.lat, lng: point.lng })
    })
  }
  
  map.fitBounds(bounds)
}
```

This ensures that when stations are loaded, the map automatically zooms and pans to show all of them. **This was likely the main issue** - markers were being created but the map was zoomed to the wrong location.

## ✅ Testing Checklist

- [ ] Open route planning page
- [ ] Open browser console (F12)
- [ ] Enter origin and destination
- [ ] Click "Plan Route"
- [ ] Wait for API response
- [ ] Check console logs for station processing
- [ ] Check console logs for marker creation
- [ ] Verify map auto-zooms to show stations
- [ ] Verify markers appear (orange and/or green)
- [ ] Click a marker to see details

## 📈 Success Criteria

✅ Stations are received from n8n API
✅ Coordinates are parsed correctly
✅ Markers are created on the map
✅ Map automatically zooms to show all stations
✅ Markers are clickable
✅ Station details appear when clicked
✅ Color coding works (orange = selected, green = available)

## 🎉 Result

With these changes, the station display should work **once and for all**:
1. ✅ Comprehensive debugging for easy troubleshooting
